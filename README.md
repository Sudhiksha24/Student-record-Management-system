STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Student Record Management System (SRMS) is a console-based Java application designed to manage student profiles, academic performance, and attendance records in an organized and structured manner.

This project demonstrates strong implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, custom exception handling, and layered architecture design using Core Java.

The system simulates real-world academic record management by enabling validation, updates, and performance reporting without relying on a database.
